# Topology-Animations
Within this repository are the various animations used within the Medium article currently being drafted.

For these animations I am using the python library Manim.
For instructions on how to install Manim refer to:
https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html

Note: Manim takes some time to install.
